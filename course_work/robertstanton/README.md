### README.md 

#### Folder Contents

- Python folder contains the day one exercises/addition of the integrators.

- MIW folder contains the 1D implementation of the MIW forces, with example being in a harmonic oscillator.

- Parameter Fitting contains the fitting process of LJ parameters to a Cd44S44 Quantum Dot.

- NACsImidazole added. Used cp2k/libra to compute nacs for an imidazole ring. Stopped at NACs and didn't do any step4 due to time and the results not seeming so reliable.

- ProjectLog contains the pdf description of all projects.
