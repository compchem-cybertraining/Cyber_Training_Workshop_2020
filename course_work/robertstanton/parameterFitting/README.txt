Contains input script, job script, datafile (hdf5), and scripts folder used for plots.
Additionally includes images used in the final project PDF.
MM_ dir including all cp2k MM outpu is not included at all (even tar'd) because it's ~18GB, which seems a bit excessive.


Update: datafiles (armc.*) were deleted because they're simply too large.
