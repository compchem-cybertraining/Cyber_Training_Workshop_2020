#Project folder for the cybertraining workshop 2021.

Please note I have too many files that I think it would be too much to upload, and so sample inputs and outputs are included in the 2x4 folder.
All coordinates used in the project are in the coords folder as well.

Included in this folder is the pdf version of my report as well as the powerpoint presentation.
