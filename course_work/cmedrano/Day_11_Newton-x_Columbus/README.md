This folder contains the tutorial of Mario Barbatti for using
Newton-x with Columbus.
There are 7 folders (some of them compressed). The folders and
their objectives are:

T1_Columbus_initCond: Prepare Coloumbus input for initial conditions
T2_NXIC: Compute initial conditions 
T3_NXSPECT: Compute spectrum
T4_NXSELECTIC: Select initial conditions
T5_COLDYN: Prepare Columbus input for trajectories
T6_NXDYN: Prepare and run trajectories
T7_NXANALYSIS: Analysis

There are also two figures that show the main results:

spectrum.png : shows the calculated absorption spectrum of fulvene
obtained from 5 trajectories. This is not realistic but for the
tutorial time constrain is OK.

occ_vs_pop.png : shows the comparison of the occupations (obtained 
from 20 NA trajectories) with the populations. They are quite similar.
