[Go back to TOC](../../../README.md)

This folder contains the files required to carry out the non-adiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) for both organic complexes. The files are divide into two different folders (each for each complex). Inside each folder, you are going to find the following folders:
1-QE-MD  
2-Vibronic-Hamiltonian  
3-build-SD-basis  
4-NBRA-MD
The workflow for the calculations is defined for the number of the folders (e.g., begin running first the 1-QE-MD folder). To carry out the calculation, you have to open and run the jupyter-notebook.
Be sure to review each README.md folder to ensure that you do not have to take into account previous steps before running your calculation.
