1-Extended-Huckel-Theory
2-Libra-QE  
3-QmFlows

All folders contain the input files request to carry out the calculations that are schematic in Jupyter-notebook. All Jupyter-notebooks were modified from the set of Tutorials developed by Professor Alexey Akimov available in  https://github.com/compchem-cybertraining/Tutorials_Libra.git
