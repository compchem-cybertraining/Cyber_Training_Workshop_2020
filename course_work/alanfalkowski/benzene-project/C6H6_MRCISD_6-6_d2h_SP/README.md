Description:
-----------

Single point calculation with the MR-CISD method, performed in the COLUMBUS package. The active space used is MRCI(6,6), the same electrons and orbitals used in the CAS(6,6). More details about the table of orbitals are in the file "C6H6_CAS_6-6_d2h_table.odt".

The calculations has been performed with the aug-cc-pVDZ basis set and the point group used is the D2h.


Acronyms used:
-------------

SCF: Self Consistent Field

CAS: Complete Active Space

MRCI: Multi Reference Configutation Interaction

MR-CISD: MRCI with Singles and Doubles excitations
