Day 1 contains a Jupyter Notebok with code for the following:
1. computes f(x) = Ax^n
2. computes f(x) = exp(x) truncated to the nth degee
3. function that computes the force that arises from the harmonic potential
4. Euler integration both with loops and vectorized
5. Verlet/Leapfrog integration scheme
6. Runge-Kutta Integration scheme
7. Simpson's rule for computing integrals.
