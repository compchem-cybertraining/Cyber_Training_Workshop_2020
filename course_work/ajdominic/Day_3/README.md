Day 3 contains:
1. 1_matrix_elements - worked on the GWP exercises within the tutorial inside of this directory

2. 5_atomistic_adiabatic_excited_states - successfully ran tutorial by changing the path to include data1 in the dftb_input_template.hsd file

3. Compared code in 2_model_adiabatic_ehrenfest_fssh, 3_model_ehrenfest_recipes, and 5_atomistic_adiabatic_excited_states with my current codes for Ehrenfest dynamics and FSSH for the spin-boson model.

4. Directory named "other" that contains other codes that I would like to compare to my Ehrenfest and FSSH at some point.
