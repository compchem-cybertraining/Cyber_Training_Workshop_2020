This tutorial demonstrates running adiabatic and nonadiabatic molecular dynamics of systems in model potentials. 
A particular emphasis is placed on a smooth and logical transition between these methods - their similar framework.

Topics covered: 
 * adiabatic MD on ground or excited states
 * Ehrenfest dynamics
 * surface hopping dynamics via Fewest Switches Surface Hopping (FSSH)
 * data storage in an HDF5 format and access to these files for plotting and analysis
 * setting up the initial electronic and nuclear conditions
