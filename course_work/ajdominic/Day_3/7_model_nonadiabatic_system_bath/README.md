This tutorial demonstrates running non-adiabatic molecular dynamics with model Hamiltonians in the presence of thermostats.
One can also designate which DOFs should be treated by TSH and which should be trated fully classically, one can control 
which DOFs shall be coupled to thermostat and which shall be kept fixed
