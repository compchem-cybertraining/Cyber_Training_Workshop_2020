nexmd_analysis directory contains:
1. plots.ipynb contains the single-point computations in both vacuum and in a solvent. In the case with a solvent, the simulation was run using the linear response (LR) solvation model with the COSMO potential and a dieelectric constant of 30 to mimc the effects of a polar solvent.
2. header contains the simulation conditions from which the nexmd simulations were run. The nexmd simulation computed 1000 classical steps with 3 quantum steps per classical step.
3. data.tar.bz2 is a zip file that contains the necessary inputs to reproduce my final figures. I also compressed .jpeg images of the figures for reference.
