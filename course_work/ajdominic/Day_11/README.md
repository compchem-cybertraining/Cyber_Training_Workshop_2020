Day_11 contains:
1. nexmd_analysis which contains the final results used for my presentation. Single-point calculations are also included for the reader's convenience.
2. geometry_optimization contains my first attempt at performing a geometry optimization for a single chlorophyll molecule. This will be the starting point for my research beyond the workshop.
