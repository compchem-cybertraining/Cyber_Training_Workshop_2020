geometry_optimization contains:
1. chla_coords contains the coordinates of a single chlorophyll molecule (52 atoms) with a methyl group in place of the phytyl group.
2. input.ceon contains my first attempt at constructing an input file for this system. I need to figure out how to fix the positions of the 4 nitrogen atoms at the porphyrin center.
3. md.out contains the output from the geometry optimization I attempted to run with nexmd. This will be the starting point for my research beyond the workshop.
