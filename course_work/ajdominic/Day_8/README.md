Day_6 contains:
1. chla_dimer.cif: the coordinates for residues 613 and 614 (chlorophyll a dimer) from chain B of 1RWT.pdb; these will be used to compute their absorption spectrum and the results will be compared to those found in J. Phys. Chem. B 2017, 121, 5331-5339. 
2. Directory entitled gs_analysis which contains a Jupyter notebook with temperature and energy plots for the ground state simulation of the polyphenylene ethynylene dendrimer (PPE). I plan to use NEXMD to reproduce the figures for PPE found in J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2020, 16, 5771-5783 before moving on to my studies with Chlorophyll a.
