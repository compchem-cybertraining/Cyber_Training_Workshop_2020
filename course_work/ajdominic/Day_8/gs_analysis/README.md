gs_analysis contains:
1. output files from the ground state molecular dynamics simulation of PPE: energy-ev.out and tempurature.out.
2. data which was extracted from these files: time.txt, temp.txt, time_energy.txt, kinetic.txt, potential.txt, total_E.txt
3. most importantly a file entitled plots.ipynb which contains plots of temperature vs time and energy vs time throughout the duration of this gs simulation.
