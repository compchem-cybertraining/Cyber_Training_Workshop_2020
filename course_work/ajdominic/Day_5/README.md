Day_5 contains:
1. Practicing plotting data and reading files from NEXMD outputs. plots.ipynb shows the energetics and temperature of the system during this calculation.
2. More practice with plotting this data and a script to make the files easier to manage with Python. I didn't include all of the simulations I ran to save space.
