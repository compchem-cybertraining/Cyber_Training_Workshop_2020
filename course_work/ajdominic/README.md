This directory contains the exercises/tutorials I have completed on each day of the workshop and will ultimately have 11 folders (e.g., Day_1, ..., Day_11), assuming that the last day will be reserved for presentations.

* Day_1 contains the molecular dynamics coding exercises from the first day
* Day_2 contains the derivation from the Pyxaid paper as well as 1_pes_plotting and a file called demos with 1_single_points and 2_derivative couplings that I followed along with. Note that these directories were copied from there original place and may not work as they don't have the required inputs. 
* Day_3 contains many tutorials that I followed along with and experimented with the parameters to get an intuition for these workflows.
* Day_4 contains my practice with NBRA workflows as well as some other exercises with qmflows
* Day_5 contains data from the NEXMD simulation examples (single-point and bomd)
* Day_7 contains my original ground state analysis for PPE as well as my coordinates for the chlorophyll a dimer that I would like to simulate. I obtained these using PyMol with the PDBID 1RWT.
* Day_8 contains an updated version of the ground state analysis as well as a new single-point calculation analysis directory. This directory also contains a slurm file that was used to run my NEXMD simulations.
* Day_9 contains my initial attempts at running a ground state MD simulation with NEXMD as well as my first single-point calculation.
* Day_10 contains my updated single-point calculations in vacuum as well as the single-point calcaultions in solvent.
* Day_11 contains all of the simulations I have run for PPE with NEXMD. In the directory titled nexmd_analysis, there is a jupyter notebook that contains the optical spectra of PPE in vacuum and in solvent as well as the adiabatic population dynamics observed in the nonadiabatic dynamics simulation.
* project_summary.pdf is my first draft of the final summary of this workshop.
