sp_analysis (single-point analysis) contains:
1. output files from the single-point calculation of PPE, ceo_gauss.out.
2. The file named `header` contains the file used to run getexcited.py with the parameters set for a single-point calculation. I followed the reference for PPE closely.
3. most importantly a file entitled plots.ipynb which contains plots of absorbance vs energy for each PPE excited state as well as the total spectrum in a vacuum.
