Day_7 contains:
1. gs_analysis (ground state analysis) contains the temperature and energy outputs for a ground state MD simulation of the PPE dendrimer, which are visualized in a Jupyter notebook entitled plots.ipnb.
2. sp_analysis (single-point analysis) contains the data from the single-point calculations of PPE. The spectra are visualized in a Jupyter notebook entitled plots.ipynb.
3. submit.slm is the slurm file that I used to submit my jobs for the NEXMD simulation.
